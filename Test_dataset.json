A 2019 study by the Tent Partnership for Refugees found that refugees contribute billions of dollars to the economies of host countries, with evidence showing that, on average, each refugee can contribute approximately $21,000 to the GDP of the host country within five years. Research by the Migration Policy Institute in 2020 highlighted that the integration of refugees leads to enhanced cultural diversity, fostering innovation and social cohesion, with refugee populations bringing new perspectives and skills that enrich the cultural fabric of host countries. Due to the particularly precarious and vulnerable position refugees are in, there is a moral obligation on high-income countries to take them in. The UNHCR reported in 2018 that 85% of refugees reside in developing regions under severe conditions, often lacking access to basic necessities such as clean water, food, and shelter, highlighting the urgent need for high-income countries to provide safe havens. A 2017 study by the International Rescue Committee found that refugees face extreme risks, including violence, exploitation, and human trafficking, with women and children being particularly vulnerable, reinforcing the ethical duty of high-income countries to offer protection and support. Due to their wealth, high-income countries have the financial ability and a special obligation to take in refugees. According to the World Bank, high-income countries, which account for about 16% of the global population, hold over 75% of the world’s wealth, indicating their financial capacity to support and integrate refugees effectively. A 2018 OECD report found that high-income countries with structured integration programs, such as Germany and Canada, successfully integrate refugees into their labor markets, with refugee employment rates reaching up to 60% within five years of resettlement, demonstrating their ability to absorb and support refugee populations.", "label": "perfect"},

{"pyramid": "High-income countries should take in significant numbers of refugees. It is in the long-term interests of humanity for high-income countries to host refugees. Some critics argue that the immediate costs of resettling refugees, such as housing, healthcare, and education, can strain public budgets, as evidenced by a 2016 report from the Cato Institute which highlighted initial resettlement costs exceeding $15,000 per refugee. Anecdotal reports suggest that the influx of refugees can lead to social tensions and cultural clashes within communities, as seen in various European countries during the 2015 refugee crisis. Due to the particularly precarious and vulnerable position refugees are in, there is a moral obligation on high-income countries to take them in. A 2018 Pew Research Center survey found that 51% of respondents in European countries believed that refugees would increase the risk of terrorism, reflecting significant public opposition and fear that complicates the moral argument. A report by the Migration Watch UK in 2017 indicated that refugees often face significant barriers to integration, such as language difficulties and unemployment, which can undermine the moral imperative by suggesting that high-income countries may not always be equipped to support refugees effectively. Due to their wealth, high-income countries have the financial ability and a special obligation to take in refugees. A 2019 study by the Center for Immigration Studies argued that the long-term fiscal impact of refugees on high-income countries can be negative, citing an average net fiscal cost of $60,000 per refugee over a 20-year period. Some policymakers argue that high-income countries should prioritize their own citizens over refugees, pointing to national issues such as homelessness and unemployment; for example, a 2018 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office noted that federal assistance for refugees sometimes faces criticism amid domestic welfare concerns.", "label": "badevidence"},

A 2021 study by the EdChoice organization found that 78% of parents utilizing education vouchers reported higher satisfaction with their children’s schooling compared to only 52% of parents whose children attended public schools. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that states with voucher programs saw a 15% increase in enrollment in private and charter schools, indicating that vouchers significantly expand educational choices for parents. School vouchers offer students in failing schools access to a better education. A 2020 report by the Sutton Trust found that 60% of students from low-income families who used school vouchers in the UK were able to attend higher-performing private schools, significantly improving their educational outcomes compared to their peers in failing state schools. The Institute of Economic Affairs highlighted that in areas with school voucher programs, 70% of participating private schools reported an increase in enrollment from low-income students, demonstrating that vouchers effectively provide access to better educational opportunities for those trapped in underperforming state schools. School vouchers allow school districts to overcome racial and other segregations. A study by the Brookings Institution found that school voucher programs in Milwaukee led to a 13% increase in racial integration within schools, as vouchers enabled students from diverse backgrounds to attend previously less accessible private institutions. The U.S. Department of Education reported that voucher programs have helped reduce economic segregation by 18% in participating districts, allowing students from low-income families to attend schools with more affluent peers, fostering a more integrated educational environment.", "label": "perfect"},

According to a report by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, land value tax is more straightforward to administer and enforce compared to income and corporate taxes, which can be evaded through various loopholes. It would eliminate the boom-bust cycle in house and land prices. Economic studies have shown that land value tax stabilizes real estate markets by reducing speculative bubbles, as seen in countries that have implemented it like Denmark. The IMF has found that land value tax can lead to more stable property prices by discouraging speculative investments and promoting long-term ownership. The change in tax policy would increase individuals' and society's economic efficiency and productivity. Land is ideal for taxation because the supply of land is fixed, and therefore more taxation doesn't decrease the supply. It would encourage people to make optimal use of their land to make up for land taxes, as demonstrated by research from the Urban Institute, which found that land value tax incentivizes better land use and development, boosting overall economic productivity.", "label": "badevidence"},
{"pyramid": "A land value tax should be introduced to replace other taxes. Land value tax is difficult to implement and enforce. Setting accurate land values for taxation purposes can be complex and contentious, leading to disputes and inconsistencies. Local governments might lack the necessary infrastructure and expertise to assess and collect land value taxes effectively. Land value tax could lead to unfair financial burdens on landowners. Property owners, particularly those with large landholdings but limited income, might struggle to pay the land value tax. This could result in forced sales or increased debt for some landowners, negatively impacting their financial stability. The transition to a land value tax could disrupt the current economic system. Businesses and individuals accustomed to the existing tax structure might face uncertainty and financial strain during the transition period. The sudden shift in tax policy could destabilize markets and reduce investor confidence, leading to economic volatility.", "label": "badevidence"},
{"pyramid": "A land value tax should be introduced to replace other taxes. A land value tax (LVT) encourages the efficient use of land, as it taxes the unimproved value of land rather than the buildings on it, reducing speculation and promoting development. Some reports suggest that land value tax could create administrative challenges due to variations in land value assessments. Critics argue that implementing a land value tax requires significant upfront investment in assessment and enforcement infrastructure. It would eliminate the boom-bust cycle in house and land prices. However, historical data from countries with land value taxes show mixed results in stabilizing real estate markets. Some studies indicate that other factors, such as economic policies and market conditions, play a more significant role in real estate stability. The change in tax policy would increase individuals' and society's economic efficiency and productivity. Some economists argue that land value tax alone is insufficient to drive significant improvements in economic efficiency without complementary policies. Research indicates that the impact of land value tax on productivity varies greatly depending on local economic conditions and land use practices.", "label": "badevidence"},
{"pyramid": "A license should be required in order to have a child (procreate). A licensing system controlling procreation would enable the government to direct human evolution towards positive eugenic ends. A study published in Nature Genetics found that genetic interventions could potentially reduce the prevalence of certain hereditary diseases by up to 70%, suggesting that a controlled procreation system could significantly improve public health outcomes. A license to procreate could, in a matter of a few generations, transform us into a master race, as suggested by proponents of eugenics like Francis Galton, though this view is highly controversial and ethically problematic. A licensing system could help prevent child abuse and neglect by ensuring that only those who meet certain standards of care and stability are allowed to have children. According to a 2019 report by the US Department of Health and Human Services, over 80% of child abuse cases are linked to factors such as parental substance abuse, mental health issues, and economic instability, suggesting that screening potential parents for these factors could reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect. A study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that children raised in stable and supportive environments, characterized by the absence of neglect and abuse, are 60% more likely to achieve positive developmental outcomes, indicating that a licensing system could promote healthier and safer childhoods by ensuring parental fitness. A parenting license system will lead to better childcare and parenting. Requiring potential parents to undergo training and evaluation could lead to more informed and prepared parents, similar to the benefits seen in pre-adoption parent training programs. Studies from the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry show that parents who receive pre-parenting education and support tend to have better outcomes in terms of child development and family stability.", "label": "perfect"},

It would be fair towards people who have to adopt to make the procedure to choose for procreation equally complex. However, some argue that biological parenting should remain a fundamental right, distinct from the adoption process. Legal scholars highlight the importance of reproductive rights and the potential for discriminatory practices in licensing systems.

Most animals used in experiments are usually bred in captivity and live stressful, monotonous, and unnatural lives of daily confinement and deprivation, according to a report by the Humane Society. There are preferable alternatives to animal testing that are more accurate and more humane. Advances in technology have led to the development of in vitro testing methods and computer modeling, which can provide more relevant data on human responses without the use of animals. A study published in the journal Alternatives to Animal Testing and Experimentation found that methods such as organ-on-a-chip technology and 3D human tissue models can better predict human reactions to drugs and cosmetics than animal models. Testing on animals is comparably unethical. If humans are to use the product (cosmetics), they should have to pay the price by having it tested on them, or another sort of scientific testing that does not involve harming an animal who will have nothing to do with the end product. Ethical considerations highlighted by organizations like PETA emphasize that subjecting animals to painful and distressing experiments for human benefit violates principles of compassion and respect for all living beings.", "label": "badclaim"},

Without animal testing, the development of vaccines and other medical innovations would be significantly delayed or halted. Alternatives to animal testing are not yet sufficiently developed to replace it. Despite advancements in technology, in vitro testing methods and computer models cannot yet fully replicate the complexity of living organisms. Many researchers argue that current alternatives do not provide comprehensive data required for ensuring the safety and efficacy of new treatments. The ethical concerns of animal testing are outweighed by the potential benefits to human health.

{"pyramid": "Anyone should be allowed to be a parent. Any restrictions on what constitutes a 'good' parent are likely tainted by the zeitgeist of the time. Animals are capable of parenting without having any of the skills our society views as being essential. Morality changes over time, and what was once considered good parenting can be viewed differently as societal norms evolve, as seen in the changing views on corporal punishment. No one has a right to restrict another person's ability to reproduce. The power to make these decisions is too easily corrupted or influenced by ideas such as class systems and religion, as demonstrated by the eugenics movements in the early 20th century. Historically, invasive and sexually abusive techniques have been used to restrict reproductive capacity among populations deemed undesirable, such as forced sterilizations of marginalized groups in the United States and other countries. Anyone should get the chance to prove they are a good parent. Numerous individuals who were initially deemed unfit for parenthood have proven to be loving and capable parents, as seen in various case studies from child welfare organizations.

Many people who beg do so out of necessity and have no immediate alternative means of support. Surveys indicate that a significant portion of beggars are unable to work due to mental health issues, disabilities, or other barriers. Providing support services rather than criminalizing begging can more effectively address these underlying issues. Begging provides immediate relief to those in need, which structured programs may not offer. Direct assistance from the public can provide quick, if temporary, relief for individuals in crisis.
